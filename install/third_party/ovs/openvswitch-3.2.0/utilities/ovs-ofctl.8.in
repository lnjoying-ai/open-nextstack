.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ovs\-ofctl
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand \fR[\fIswitch\fR] [\fIargs\fR\&...]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ovs\-ofctl
program is a command line tool for monitoring and administering
OpenFlow switches.  It can also show the current state of an OpenFlow
switch, including features, configuration, and table entries.
It should work with any OpenFlow switch, not just Open vSwitch.
.
.SS "OpenFlow Switch Management Commands"
.PP
These commands allow \fBovs\-ofctl\fR to monitor and administer an OpenFlow
switch.  It is able to show the current state of a switch, including
features, configuration, and table entries.
.PP
Most of these commands take an argument that specifies the method for
connecting to an OpenFlow switch.  The following connection methods
are supported:
.
.RS
.so lib/vconn-active.man
.
.IP "\fIfile\fR"
This is short for \fBunix:\fIfile\fR, as long as \fIfile\fR does not
contain a colon.
.
.IP \fIbridge\fR
This is short for \fBunix:@RUNDIR@/\fIbridge\fB.mgmt\fR, as long as
\fIbridge\fR does not contain a colon.
.
.IP [\fItype\fB@\fR]\fIdp\fR
Attempts to look up the bridge associated with \fIdp\fR and open as
above.  If \fItype\fR is given, it specifies the datapath provider of
\fIdp\fR, otherwise the default provider \fBsystem\fR is assumed.
.RE
.
.TP
\fBshow \fIswitch\fR
Prints to the console information on \fIswitch\fR, including
information on its flow tables and ports.
.
.TP
\fBdump\-tables \fIswitch\fR
Prints to the console statistics for each of the flow tables used by
\fIswitch\fR.
.TP
\fBdump\-table\-features \fIswitch\fR
Prints to the console features for each of the flow tables used by
\fIswitch\fR.
.TP
\fBdump\-table\-desc \fIswitch\fR
Prints to the console configuration for each of the flow tables used
by \fIswitch\fR for OpenFlow 1.4+.
.IP "\fBmod\-table \fIswitch\fR \fItable\fR \fIsetting\fR"
This command configures flow table settings in \fIswitch\fR for
OpenFlow table \fItable\fR, which may be expressed as a number or
(unless \fB\-\-no\-names\fR is specified) a name.
.IP
The available settings depend on
the OpenFlow version in use.  In OpenFlow 1.1 and 1.2 (which must be
enabled with the \fB\-O\fR option) only, \fBmod\-table\fR configures
behavior when no flow is found when a packet is looked up in a flow
table.  The following \fIsetting\fR values are available:
.RS
.IP \fBdrop\fR
Drop the packet.
.IP \fBcontinue\fR
Continue to the next table in the pipeline.  (This is how an OpenFlow
1.0 switch always handles packets that do not match any flow, in
tables other than the last one.)
.IP \fBcontroller\fR
Send to controller.  (This is how an OpenFlow 1.0 switch always
handles packets that do not match any flow in the last table.)
.RE
.IP
In OpenFlow 1.3 and later (which must be enabled with the \fB\-O\fR
option) and Open vSwitch 2.11 and later only, \fBmod\-table\fR can
change the name of a table:
.RS
.IP \fBname:\fInew-name\fR
Changes the name of the table to \fInew-name\fR.  Use an empty
\fInew-name\fR to clear the name.  (This will be ineffective if the
name is set via the \fBname\fR column in the \fBFlow_Table\fR table in
the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR database as described in
\fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5).)
.RE
.IP
In OpenFlow 1.4 and later (which must be enabled with the \fB\-O\fR
option) only, \fBmod\-table\fR configures the behavior when a
controller attempts to add a flow to a flow table that is full.  The
following \fIsetting\fR values are available:
.RS
.IP \fBevict\fR
Delete some existing flow from the flow table, according to the
algorithm described for the \fBFlow_Table\fR table in
\fBovs-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5).
.IP \fBnoevict\fR
Refuse to add the new flow.  (Eviction might still be enabled through
the \fBoverflow_policy\fR column in the \fBFlow_Table\fR table
documented in \fBovs-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5).)
.IP \fBvacancy:\fIlow\fB,\fIhigh\fR
Enables sending vacancy events to controllers using \fBTABLE_STATUS\fR
messages, based on percentage thresholds \fIlow\fR and \fIhigh\fR.
.IP \fBnovacancy\fR
Disables vacancy events.
.RE
.
.TP
\fBdump\-ports \fIswitch\fR [\fInetdev\fR]
Prints to the console statistics for network devices associated with 
\fIswitch\fR.  If \fInetdev\fR is specified, only the statistics
associated with that device will be printed.  \fInetdev\fR can be an
OpenFlow assigned port number or device name, e.g. \fBeth0\fR.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-ports\-desc \fIswitch\fR [\fIport\fR]"
Prints to the console detailed information about network devices
associated with \fIswitch\fR.  To dump only a specific port, specify
its number as \fIport\fR.  Otherwise, if \fIport\fR is omitted, or if
it is specified as \fBANY\fR, then all ports are printed.  This is a
subset of the information provided by the \fBshow\fR command.
.IP
If the connection to \fIswitch\fR negotiates OpenFlow 1.0, 1.2, or
1.2, this command uses an OpenFlow extension only implemented in Open
vSwitch (version 1.7 and later).
.IP
Only OpenFlow 1.5 and later support dumping a specific port.  Earlier
versions of OpenFlow always dump all ports.
.
.IP "\fBmod\-port \fIswitch\fR \fIport\fR \fIaction\fR"
Modify characteristics of port \fBport\fR in \fIswitch\fR.  \fIport\fR
may be an OpenFlow port number or name (unless \fB\-\-no\-names\fR is
specified) or the keyword \fBLOCAL\fR (the
preferred way to refer to the OpenFlow local port).  The \fIaction\fR
may be any one of the following:
.
.RS
.IQ \fBup\fR
.IQ \fBdown\fR
Enable or disable the interface.  This is equivalent to \fBip
link set up\fR or \fBip link set down\fR on a Unix system.
.
.IP \fBstp\fR
.IQ \fBno\-stp\fR
Enable or disable 802.1D spanning tree protocol (STP) on the
interface.  OpenFlow implementations that don't support STP will
refuse to enable it.
.
.IP \fBreceive\fR
.IQ \fBno\-receive\fR
.IQ \fBreceive\-stp\fR
.IQ \fBno\-receive\-stp\fR
Enable or disable OpenFlow processing of packets received on this
interface.  When packet processing is disabled, packets will be
dropped instead of being processed through the OpenFlow table.  The
\fBreceive\fR or \fBno\-receive\fR setting applies to all packets
except 802.1D spanning tree packets, which are separately controlled
by \fBreceive\-stp\fR or \fBno\-receive\-stp\fR.
.
.IP \fBforward\fR
.IQ \fBno\-forward\fR
Allow or disallow forwarding of traffic to this interface.  By
default, forwarding is enabled.
.
.IP \fBflood\fR
.IQ \fBno\-flood\fR
Controls whether an OpenFlow \fBflood\fR action will send traffic out
this interface.  By default, flooding is enabled.  Disabling flooding
is primarily useful to prevent loops when a spanning tree protocol is
not in use.
.
.IP \fBpacket\-in\fR
.IQ \fBno\-packet\-in\fR
Controls whether packets received on this interface that do not match
a flow table entry generate a ``packet in'' message to the OpenFlow
controller.  By default, ``packet in'' messages are enabled.
.RE
.IP
The \fBshow\fR command displays (among other information) the
configuration that \fBmod\-port\fR changes.
.
.IP "\fBget\-frags \fIswitch\fR"
Prints \fIswitch\fR's fragment handling mode.  See \fBset\-frags\fR,
below, for a description of each fragment handling mode.
.IP
The \fBshow\fR command also prints the fragment handling mode among
its other output.
.
.IP "\fBset\-frags \fIswitch frag_mode\fR"
Configures \fIswitch\fR's treatment of IPv4 and IPv6 fragments.  The
choices for \fIfrag_mode\fR are:
.RS
.IP "\fBnormal\fR"
Fragments pass through the flow table like non-fragmented packets.
The TCP ports, UDP ports, and ICMP type and code fields are always set
to 0, even for fragments where that information would otherwise be
available (fragments with offset 0).  This is the default fragment
handling mode for an OpenFlow switch.
.IP "\fBdrop\fR"
Fragments are dropped without passing through the flow table.
.IP "\fBreassemble\fR"
The switch reassembles fragments into full IP packets before passing
them through the flow table.  Open vSwitch does not implement this
fragment handling mode.
.IP "\fBnx\-match\fR"
Fragments pass through the flow table like non-fragmented packets.
The TCP ports, UDP ports, and ICMP type and code fields are available
for matching for fragments with offset 0, and set to 0 in fragments
with nonzero offset.  This mode is a Nicira extension.
.RE
.IP
See the description of \fBip_frag\fR, in \fBovs\-fields\fR(7), for a way to
match on whether a packet is a fragment and on its fragment offset.
.
.TP
\fBdump\-flows \fIswitch \fR[\fIflows\fR]
Prints to the console all flow entries in \fIswitch\fR's
tables that match \fIflows\fR.  If \fIflows\fR is omitted, all flows
in the switch are retrieved.  See \fBFlow Syntax\fR, below, for the
syntax of \fIflows\fR.  The output format is described in
\fBTable Entry Output\fR.
.
.IP
By default, \fBovs\-ofctl\fR prints flow entries in the same order
that the switch sends them, which is unlikely to be intuitive or
consistent.  Use \fB\-\-sort\fR and \fB\-\-rsort\fR to control display
order.  The \fB\-\-names\fR/\fB\-\-no\-names\fR and
\fB\-\-stats\fR/\fB\-\-no\-stats\fR options also affect output
formatting.  See the descriptions of these options, under
\fBOPTIONS\fR below, for more information
.
.TP
\fBdump\-aggregate \fIswitch \fR[\fIflows\fR]
Prints to the console aggregate statistics for flows in
\fIswitch\fR's tables that match \fIflows\fR.  If \fIflows\fR is omitted, 
the statistics are aggregated across all flows in the switch's flow
tables.  See \fBFlow Syntax\fR, below, for the syntax of \fIflows\fR.
The output format is described in \fBTable Entry Output\fR.
.
.IP "\fBqueue\-stats \fIswitch \fR[\fIport \fR[\fIqueue\fR]]"
Prints to the console statistics for the specified \fIqueue\fR on
\fIport\fR within \fIswitch\fR.  \fIport\fR can be an OpenFlow port
number or name, the keyword \fBLOCAL\fR (the preferred way to refer to
the OpenFlow local port), or the keyword \fBALL\fR.  Either of
\fIport\fR or \fIqueue\fR or both may be omitted (or equivalently the
keyword \fBALL\fR).  If both are omitted, statistics are printed for
all queues on all ports.  If only \fIqueue\fR is omitted, then
statistics are printed for all queues on \fIport\fR; if only
\fIport\fR is omitted, then statistics are printed for \fIqueue\fR on
every port where it exists.
.
.IP "\fBqueue\-get\-config \fIswitch [\fIport \fR[\fIqueue\fR]]"
Prints to the console the configuration of \fIqueue\fR on \fIport\fR
in \fIswitch\fR.  If \fIport\fR is omitted or \fBANY\fR, reports
queues for all port.  If \fIqueue\fR is omitted or \fBANY\fR, reports
all queues.  For OpenFlow 1.3 and earlier, the output always includes
all queues, ignoring \fIqueue\fR if specified.
.IP
This command has limited usefulness, because ports often have no
configured queues and because the OpenFlow protocol provides only very
limited information about the configuration of a queue.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-ipfix\-bridge \fIswitch\fR"
Prints to the console the statistics of bridge IPFIX for \fIswitch\fR.
If bridge IPFIX is configured on the \fIswitch\fR, IPFIX statistics
can be retrieved.  Otherwise, error message will be printed.
.IP
This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only in Open
vSwitch 2.6 and later.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-ipfix\-flow \fIswitch\fR"
Prints to the console the statistics of flow-based IPFIX for
\fIswitch\fR.  If flow-based IPFIX is configured on the \fIswitch\fR,
statistics of all the collector set ids on the \fIswitch\fR will be
printed.  Otherwise, print error message.
.IP
Refer to \fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for more details on configuring
flow based IPFIX and collector set ids.
.IP
This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only in Open
vSwitch 2.6 and later.
.
.IP "\fBct\-flush\-zone \fIswitch zone\fR
Flushes the connection tracking entries in \fIzone\fR on \fIswitch\fR.
.IP
This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only in Open
vSwitch 2.6 and later.
.
.IP "\fBct\-flush \fIswitch [zone=N] [ct-orig-tuple [ct-reply-tuple]]\fR
Flushes the connection entries on \fIswitch\fR based on \fIzone\fR and
connection tracking tuples \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR.
.IP
If \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR is not provided, flushes all the connection
entries.  If \fIzone\fR is specified, only flushes the connections in
\fIzone\fR.
.IP
If \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR is provided, flushes the connection entry
specified by \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR in \fIzone\fR.  The zone defaults
to 0 if it is not provided.  The userspace connection tracker requires flushing
with the original pre-NATed tuple and a warning log will be otherwise
generated.  The tuple can be partial and will remove all connections that are
matching on the specified fields.  In order to specify only
\fIct-reply-tuple\fR, provide empty string as \fIct-orig-tuple\fR.
.IP
Note: Currently there is limitation for matching on ICMP, in order to partially
match on ICMP parameters the \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR has to include
either source or destination IP.
.IP
An example of an IPv4 ICMP \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR:
.IP
"ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"
.IP
An example of an IPv6 TCP \fIct-[orig|reply]-tuple\fR:
.IP
"ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"
.IP
This command uses an Open vSwitch extension that is only in Open vSwitch 3.1
and later.
.
.SS "OpenFlow Switch Flow Table Commands"
.
These commands manage the flow table in an OpenFlow switch.  In each
case, \fIflow\fR specifies a flow entry in the format described in
\fBFlow Syntax\fR, below, \fIfile\fR is a text file that contains zero
or more flows in the same syntax, one per line, and the optional
\fB\-\-bundle\fR option operates the command as a single atomic
transaction, see option \fB\-\-bundle\fR, below.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBadd\-flow \fIswitch flow\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBadd\-flow \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBadd\-flows \fIswitch file\fR"
Add each flow entry to \fIswitch\fR's tables.
.
Each flow specification (e.g., each line in \fIfile\fR) may start with
\fBadd\fR, \fBmodify\fR, \fBdelete\fR, \fBmodify_strict\fR, or
\fBdelete_strict\fR keyword to specify whether a flow is to be added,
modified, or deleted, and whether the modify or delete is strict or
not.  For backwards compatibility a flow specification without one of
these keywords is treated as a flow add.  All flow mods are executed
in the order specified.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] [\fB\-\-strict\fR] \fBmod\-flows \fIswitch flow\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] [\fB\-\-strict\fR] \fBmod\-flows \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
Modify the actions in entries from \fIswitch\fR's tables that match
the specified flows.  With \fB\-\-strict\fR, wildcards are not treated
as active for matching purposes.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBdel\-flows \fIswitch\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] [\fB\-\-strict\fR] \fBdel\-flows \fIswitch \fR[\fIflow\fR]"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] [\fB\-\-strict\fR] \fBdel\-flows \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
Deletes entries from \fIswitch\fR's flow table.  With only a
\fIswitch\fR argument, deletes all flows.  Otherwise, deletes flow
entries that match the specified flows.  With \fB\-\-strict\fR,
wildcards are not treated as active for matching purposes.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] [\fB\-\-readd\fR] \fBreplace\-flows \fIswitch file\fR"
Reads flow entries from \fIfile\fR (or \fBstdin\fR if \fIfile\fR is
\fB\-\fR) and queries the flow table from \fIswitch\fR.  Then it fixes
up any differences, adding flows from \fIflow\fR that are missing on
\fIswitch\fR, deleting flows from \fIswitch\fR that are not in
\fIfile\fR, and updating flows in \fIswitch\fR whose actions, cookie,
or timeouts differ in \fIfile\fR.
.
.IP
With \fB\-\-readd\fR, \fBovs\-ofctl\fR adds all the flows from
\fIfile\fR, even those that exist with the same actions, cookie, and
timeout in \fIswitch\fR.  In OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.1, re-adding a flow
always resets the flow's packet and byte counters to 0, and in
OpenFlow 1.2 and later, it does so only if the \fBreset_counts\fR flag
is set.
.
.IP "\fBdiff\-flows \fIsource1 source2\fR"
Reads flow entries from \fIsource1\fR and \fIsource2\fR and prints the
differences.  A flow that is in \fIsource1\fR but not in \fIsource2\fR
is printed preceded by a \fB\-\fR, and a flow that is in \fIsource2\fR
but not in \fIsource1\fR is printed preceded by a \fB+\fR.  If a flow
exists in both \fIsource1\fR and \fIsource2\fR with different actions,
cookie, or timeouts, then both versions are printed preceded by
\fB\-\fR and \fB+\fR, respectively.
.IP
\fIsource1\fR and \fIsource2\fR may each name a file or a switch.  If
a name begins with \fB/\fR or \fB.\fR, then it is considered to be a
file name.  A name that contains \fB:\fR is considered to be a switch.
Otherwise, it is a file if a file by that name exists, a switch if
not.
.IP
For this command, an exit status of 0 means that no differences were
found, 1 means that an error occurred, and 2 means that some
differences were found.
.
.IP "\fBpacket\-out \fIswitch\fR \fIpacket-out\fR"
Connects to \fIswitch\fR and instructs it to execute the
\fIpacket-out\fR OpenFlow message, specified as defined in
\fBPacket\-Out Syntax\fR section.
.
.SS "Group Table Commands"
.
These commands manage the group table in an OpenFlow switch.  In each
case, \fIgroup\fR specifies a group entry in the format described in
\fBGroup Syntax\fR, below, and \fIfile\fR is a text file that contains
zero or more groups in the same syntax, one per line, and the optional
\fB\-\-bundle\fR option operates the command as a single atomic
transaction, see option \fB\-\-bundle\fR, below.
.PP
The group commands work only with switches that support OpenFlow 1.1
or later or the Open vSwitch group extensions to OpenFlow 1.0 (added
in Open vSwitch 2.9.90).  For OpenFlow 1.1 or later, it is necessary
to explicitly enable these protocol versions in \fBovs\-ofctl\fR
(using \fB\-O\fR).  For more information, see ``Q: What versions of
OpenFlow does Open vSwitch support?'' in the Open vSwitch FAQ.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBadd\-group \fIswitch group\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBadd\-group \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBadd\-groups \fIswitch file\fR"
Add each group entry to \fIswitch\fR's tables.
.
Each group specification (e.g., each line in \fIfile\fR) may start
with \fBadd\fR, \fBmodify\fR, \fBadd_or_mod\fR, \fBdelete\fR,
\fBinsert_bucket\fR, or \fBremove_bucket\fR keyword to specify whether
a flow is to be added, modified, or deleted, or whether a group bucket
is to be added or removed.  For backwards compatibility a group
specification without one of these keywords is treated as a group add.
All group mods are executed in the order specified.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] [\fB\-\-may\-create\fR] \fBmod\-group \fIswitch group\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] [\fB\-\-may\-create\fR] \fBmod\-group \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
Modify the action buckets in entries from \fIswitch\fR's tables for
each group entry.  If a specified group does not already exist, then
without \fB\-\-may\-create\fR, this command has no effect; with
\fB\-\-may\-create\fR, it creates a new group.  The
\fB\-\-may\-create\fR option uses an Open vSwitch extension to
OpenFlow only implemented in Open vSwitch 2.6 and later.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBdel\-groups \fIswitch\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBdel\-groups \fIswitch \fR[\fIgroup\fR]"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBdel\-groups \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
Deletes entries from \fIswitch\fR's group table.  With only a
\fIswitch\fR argument, deletes all groups.  Otherwise, deletes the group
for each group entry.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBinsert\-buckets \fIswitch group\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBinsert\-buckets \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
Add buckets to an existing group present in the \fIswitch\fR's group table.
If no \fIcommand_bucket_id\fR is present in the group specification then all
buckets of the group are removed.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBremove\-buckets \fIswitch group\fR"
.IQ "[\fB\-\-bundle\fR] \fBremove\-buckets \fIswitch \fB\- < \fIfile\fR"
Remove buckets to an existing group present in the \fIswitch\fR's group table.
If no \fIcommand_bucket_id\fR is present in the group specification then all
buckets of the group are removed.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-groups \fIswitch\fR [\fIgroup\fR]"
Prints group entries in \fIswitch\fR's tables to console.  To dump
only a specific group, specify its number as \fIgroup\fR.  Otherwise,
if \fIgroup\fR is omitted, or if it is specified as \fBALL\fR, then
all groups are printed.
.IP
Only OpenFlow 1.5 and later support dumping a specific group.  Earlier
versions of OpenFlow always dump all groups.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-group\-features \fIswitch"
Prints to the console the group features of the \fIswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-group\-stats \fIswitch \fR[\fIgroup\fR]"
Prints to the console statistics for the specified \fIgroup\fR in
\fIswitch\fR's tables.  If \fIgroup\fR is omitted then statistics for all
groups are printed.
.
.SS "OpenFlow 1.3+ Switch Meter Table Commands"
.
These commands manage the meter table in an OpenFlow switch.  In each
case, \fImeter\fR specifies a meter entry in the format described in
\fBMeter Syntax\fR, below.
.
.PP
OpenFlow 1.3 introduced support for meters, so these commands only work
with switches that support OpenFlow 1.3 or later.  It is necessary to
explicitly enable these protocol versions in \fBovs\-ofctl\fR (using
\fB\-O\fR) and in the switch itself (with the \fBprotocols\fR column in
the \fBBridge\fR table).  For more information, see ``Q: What versions
of OpenFlow does Open vSwitch support?'' in the Open vSwitch FAQ.
.
.IP "\fBadd\-meter \fIswitch meter\fR"
Add a meter entry to \fIswitch\fR's tables. The \fImeter\fR syntax is
described in section \fBMeter Syntax\fR, below.
.
.IP "\fBmod\-meter \fIswitch meter\fR"
Modify an existing meter.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-meters \fIswitch\fR [\fImeter\fR]"
Delete entries from \fIswitch\fR's meter table.  To delete only a
specific meter, specify its number as \fImeter\fR.  Otherwise, if
\fImeter\fR is omitted, or if it is specified as \fBall\fR, then all
meters are deleted.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-meters \fIswitch\fR [\fImeter\fR]"
Print entries from \fIswitch\fR's meter table.  To print only a
specific meter, specify its number as \fImeter\fR.  Otherwise, if
\fImeter\fR is omitted, or if it is specified as \fBall\fR, then all
meters are printed.
.
.IP "\fBmeter\-stats \fIswitch\fR [\fImeter\fR]"
Print meter statistics.  \fImeter\fR can specify a single meter with
syntax \fBmeter=\fIid\fR, or all meters with syntax \fBmeter=all\fR.
.
.IP "\fBmeter\-features \fIswitch\fR"
Print meter features.
.
.SS OpenFlow Switch Bundle Command
.
Transactional updates to both flow and group tables can be made with
the \fBbundle\fR command.  \fIfile\fR is a text file that contains
zero or more flow mods, group mods, or packet-outs in \fBFlow
Syntax\fR, \fBGroup Syntax\fR, or \fBPacket\-Out Syntax\fR, each line
preceded by \fBflow\fR, \fBgroup\fR, or \fBpacket\-out\fR keyword,
correspondingly.  The \fBflow\fR keyword may be optionally followed by
one of the keywords \fBadd\fR, \fBmodify\fR, \fBmodify_strict\fR,
\fBdelete\fR, or \fBdelete_strict\fR, of which the \fBadd\fR is
assumed if a bare \fBflow\fR is given.  Similarly, the \fBgroup\fR
keyword may be optionally followed by one of the keywords \fBadd\fR,
\fBmodify\fR, \fBadd_or_mod\fR, \fBdelete\fR, \fBinsert_bucket\fR, or
\fBremove_bucket\fR, of which the \fBadd\fR is assumed if a bare
\fBgroup\fR is given.
.
.IP "\fBbundle \fIswitch file\fR"
Execute all flow and group mods in \fIfile\fR as a single atomic
transaction against \fIswitch\fR's tables.  All bundled mods are
executed in the order specified.

.SS "OpenFlow Switch Tunnel TLV Table Commands"
.
Open vSwitch maintains a mapping table between tunnel option TLVs (defined
by <class, type, length>) and NXM fields \fBtun_metadata\fIn\fR,
where \fIn\fR ranges from 0 to 63, that can be operated on for the
purposes of matches, actions, etc. This TLV table can be used for
Geneve option TLVs or other protocols with options in same TLV format
as Geneve options. This mapping must be explicitly specified by the user
through the following commands.

A TLV mapping is specified with the syntax
\fB{class=\fIclass\fB,type=\fItype\fB,len=\fIlength\fB}->tun_metadata\fIn\fR.
When an option mapping exists for a given \fBtun_metadata\fIn\fR,
matching on the defined field becomes possible, e.g.:

.RS
ovs-ofctl add-tlv-map br0 "{class=0xffff,type=0,len=4}->tun_metadata0"
.PP
ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 tun_metadata0=1234,actions=controller
.RE

A mapping should not be changed while it is in active
use by a flow. The result of doing so is undefined.

These commands are Nicira extensions to OpenFlow and require Open vSwitch
2.5 or later.

.IP "\fBadd\-tlv\-map \fIswitch option\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]..."
Add each \fIoption\fR to \fIswitch\fR's tables. Duplicate fields are
rejected.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-tlv\-map \fIswitch \fR[\fIoption\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]]..."
Delete each \fIoption\fR from \fIswitch\fR's table, or all option TLV
mapping if no \fIoption\fR is specified.
Fields that aren't mapped are ignored.
.
.IP "\fBdump\-tlv\-map \fIswitch\fR"
Show the currently mapped fields in the switch's option table as well
as switch capabilities.
.
.SS "OpenFlow Switch Monitoring Commands"
.
.IP "\fBsnoop \fIswitch\fR"
Connects to \fIswitch\fR and prints to the console all OpenFlow
messages received.  Unlike other \fBovs\-ofctl\fR commands, if
\fIswitch\fR is the name of a bridge, then the \fBsnoop\fR command
connects to a Unix domain socket named
\fB@RUNDIR@/\fIswitch\fB.snoop\fR.  \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR listens on
such a socket for each bridge and sends to it all of the OpenFlow
messages sent to or received from its configured OpenFlow controller.
Thus, this command can be used to view OpenFlow protocol activity
between a switch and its controller.
.IP
When a switch has more than one controller configured, only the
traffic to and from a single controller is output.  If none of the
controllers is configured as a primary or a secondary (using a Nicira
extension to OpenFlow 1.0 or 1.1, or a standard request in OpenFlow
1.2 or later), then a controller is chosen arbitrarily among
them.  If there is a primary controller, it is chosen; otherwise, if
there are any controllers that are not primaries or secondaries, one is
chosen arbitrarily; otherwise, a secondary controller is chosen
arbitrarily.  This choice is made once at connection time and does not
change as controllers reconfigure their roles.
.IP
If a switch has no controller configured, or if
the configured controller is disconnected, no traffic is sent, so
monitoring will not show any traffic.
.
.IP "\fBmonitor \fIswitch\fR [\fImiss-len\fR] [\fBinvalid_ttl\fR] [\fBwatch:\fR[\fIspec\fR...]]"
Connects to \fIswitch\fR and prints to the console all OpenFlow
messages received.  Usually, \fIswitch\fR should specify the name of a
bridge in the \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR database. This is available only in
OpenFlow 1.0 as Nicira extension.
.IP
If \fImiss-len\fR is provided, \fBovs\-ofctl\fR sends an OpenFlow ``set
configuration'' message at connection setup time that requests
\fImiss-len\fR bytes of each packet that misses the flow table.  Open vSwitch
does not send these and other asynchronous messages to an
\fBovs\-ofctl monitor\fR client connection unless a nonzero value is
specified on this argument.  (Thus, if \fImiss\-len\fR is not
specified, very little traffic will ordinarily be printed.)
.IP
If \fBinvalid_ttl\fR is passed, \fBovs\-ofctl\fR sends an OpenFlow ``set
configuration'' message at connection setup time that requests
\fBINVALID_TTL_TO_CONTROLLER\fR, so that \fBovs\-ofctl monitor\fR can
receive ``packet-in'' messages when TTL reaches zero on \fBdec_ttl\fR action.
Only OpenFlow 1.1 and 1.2 support \fBinvalid_ttl\fR; Open vSwitch also
implements it for OpenFlow 1.0 as an extension.
.IP
\fBwatch:\fR[\fB\fIspec\fR...] causes \fBovs\-ofctl\fR to send a
``monitor request'' Nicira extension message to the switch at
connection setup time.  This message causes the switch to send
information about flow table changes as they occur.  The following
comma-separated \fIspec\fR syntax is available:
.RS
.IP "\fB!initial\fR"
Do not report the switch's initial flow table contents.
.IP "\fB!add\fR"
Do not report newly added flows.
.IP "\fB!delete\fR"
Do not report deleted flows.
.IP "\fB!modify\fR"
Do not report modifications to existing flows.
.IP "\fB!own\fR"
Abbreviate changes made to the flow table by \fBovs\-ofctl\fR's own
connection to the switch.  (These could only occur using the
\fBofctl/send\fR command described below under \fBRUNTIME MANAGEMENT
COMMANDS\fR.)
.IP "\fB!actions\fR"
Do not report actions as part of flow updates.
.IP "\fBtable=\fItable\fR"
Limits the monitoring to the table with the given \fItable\fR, which
may be expressed as a number between 0 and 254 or (unless
\fB\-\-no\-names\fR is specified) a name.  By default, all tables are
monitored.
.IP "\fBout_port=\fIport\fR"
If set, only flows that output to \fIport\fR are monitored.  The
\fIport\fR may be an OpenFlow port number or keyword
(e.g. \fBLOCAL\fR).
.IP "\fBout_group=\fIgroup\fR"
If set, only flows that output to \fIgroup\fR number are monitored.
This field requires OpenFlow 1.4 (-OOpenFlow14) or later.
.IP "\fIfield\fB=\fIvalue\fR"
Monitors only flows that have \fIfield\fR specified as the given
\fIvalue\fR.  Any syntax valid for matching on \fBdump\-flows\fR may
be used.
.RE
.IP
This command may be useful for debugging switch or controller
implementations.  With \fBwatch:\fR, it is particularly useful for
observing how a controller updates flow tables.
.
.SS "OpenFlow Switch and Controller Commands"
.
The following commands, like those in the previous section, may be
applied to OpenFlow switches, using any of the connection methods
described in that section.  Unlike those commands, these may also be
applied to OpenFlow controllers.
.
.TP
\fBprobe \fItarget\fR
Sends a single OpenFlow echo-request message to \fItarget\fR and waits
for the response.  With the \fB\-t\fR or \fB\-\-timeout\fR option, this
command can test whether an OpenFlow switch or controller is up and
running.
.
.TP
\fBping \fItarget \fR[\fIn\fR]
Sends a series of 10 echo request packets to \fItarget\fR and times
each reply.  The echo request packets consist of an OpenFlow header
plus \fIn\fR bytes (default: 64) of randomly generated payload.  This
measures the latency of individual requests.
.
.TP
\fBbenchmark \fItarget n count\fR
Sends \fIcount\fR echo request packets that each consist of an
OpenFlow header plus \fIn\fR bytes of payload and waits for each
response.  Reports the total time required.  This is a measure of the
maximum bandwidth to \fItarget\fR for round-trips of \fIn\fR-byte
messages.
.
.SS "Other Commands"
.
.IP "\fBofp\-parse\fR \fIfile\fR"
Reads \fIfile\fR (or \fBstdin\fR if \fIfile\fR is \fB\-\fR) as a
series of OpenFlow messages in the binary format used on an OpenFlow
connection, and prints them to the console.  This can be useful for
printing OpenFlow messages captured from a TCP stream.
.
.IP "\fBofp\-parse\-pcap\fR \fIfile\fR [\fIport\fR...]"
Reads \fIfile\fR, which must be in the PCAP format used by network
capture tools such as \fBtcpdump\fR or \fBwireshark\fR, extracts all
the TCP streams for OpenFlow connections, and prints the OpenFlow
messages in those connections in human-readable format on
\fBstdout\fR.
.IP
OpenFlow connections are distinguished by TCP port number.
Non-OpenFlow packets are ignored.  By default, data on TCP ports 6633
and 6653 are considered to be OpenFlow.  Specify one or more
\fIport\fR arguments to override the default.
.IP
This command cannot usefully print SSL encrypted traffic.  It does not
understand IPv6.
.
.SS "Flow Syntax"
.PP
Some \fBovs\-ofctl\fR commands accept an argument that describes a flow or
flows.  Such flow descriptions comprise a series of
\fIfield\fB=\fIvalue\fR assignments, separated by commas or white
space.  (Embedding spaces into a flow description normally requires
quoting to prevent the shell from breaking the description into
multiple arguments.)
.PP
Flow descriptions should be in \fBnormal form\fR.  This means that a
flow may only specify a value for an L3 field if it also specifies a
particular L2 protocol, and that a flow may only specify an L4 field
if it also specifies particular L2 and L3 protocol types.  For
example, if the L2 protocol type \fBdl_type\fR is wildcarded, then L3
fields \fBnw_src\fR, \fBnw_dst\fR, and \fBnw_proto\fR must also be
wildcarded.  Similarly, if \fBdl_type\fR or \fBnw_proto\fR (the L3
protocol type) is wildcarded, so must be the L4 fields \fBtcp_dst\fR and
\fBtcp_src\fR.  \fBovs\-ofctl\fR will warn about
flows not in normal form.
.PP
\fBovs\-fields\fR(7) describes the supported fields and how to match
them.  In addition to match fields, commands that operate on flows
accept a few additional key-value pairs:
.
.IP \fBtable=\fItable\fR
For flow dump commands, limits the flows dumped to those in
\fItable\fR, which may be expressed as a number between 0 and 255 or
(unless \fB\-\-no\-names\fR is specified) a name.  If not specified
(or if 255 is specified as \fItable\fR), then flows in all tables are
dumped.
.
.IP
For flow table modification commands, behavior varies based on the
OpenFlow version used to connect to the switch:
.
.RS
.IP "OpenFlow 1.0"
OpenFlow 1.0 does not support \fBtable\fR for modifying flows.
\fBovs\-ofctl\fR will exit with an error if \fBtable\fR (other than
\fBtable=255\fR) is specified for a switch that only supports OpenFlow
1.0.
.IP
In OpenFlow 1.0, the switch chooses the table into which to insert a
new flow.  The Open vSwitch software switch always chooses table 0.
Other Open vSwitch datapaths and other OpenFlow implementations may
choose different tables.
.IP
The OpenFlow 1.0 behavior in Open vSwitch for modifying or removing
flows depends on whether \fB\-\-strict\fR is used.  Without
\fB\-\-strict\fR, the command applies to matching flows in all tables.
With \fB\-\-strict\fR, the command will operate on any single matching
flow in any table; it will do nothing if there are matches in more
than one table.  (The distinction between these behaviors only matters
if non-OpenFlow 1.0 commands were also used, because OpenFlow 1.0
alone cannot add flows with the same matching criteria to multiple
tables.)
.
.IP "OpenFlow 1.0 with table_id extension"
Open vSwitch implements an OpenFlow extension that allows the
controller to specify the table on which to operate.  \fBovs\-ofctl\fR
automatically enables the extension when \fBtable\fR is specified and
OpenFlow 1.0 is used.  \fBovs\-ofctl\fR automatically detects whether
the switch supports the extension.  As of this writing, this extension
is only known to be implemented by Open vSwitch.
.
.IP
With this extension, \fBovs\-ofctl\fR operates on the requested table
when \fBtable\fR is specified, and acts as described for OpenFlow 1.0
above when no \fBtable\fR is specified (or for \fBtable=255\fR).
.
.IP "OpenFlow 1.1"
OpenFlow 1.1 requires flow table modification commands to specify a
table.  When \fBtable\fR is not specified (or \fBtable=255\fR is
specified), \fBovs\-ofctl\fR defaults to table 0.
.
.IP "OpenFlow 1.2 and later"
OpenFlow 1.2 and later allow flow deletion commands, but not other
flow table modification commands, to operate on all flow tables, with
the behavior described above for OpenFlow 1.0.
.RE
.IP "\fBduration=\fR..."
.IQ "\fBn_packet=\fR..."
.IQ "\fBn_bytes=\fR..."
\fBovs\-ofctl\fR ignores assignments to these ``fields'' to allow
output from the \fBdump\-flows\fR command to be used as input for
other commands that parse flows.
.
.PP
The \fBadd\-flow\fR, \fBadd\-flows\fR, and \fBmod\-flows\fR commands
require an additional field, which must be the final field specified:
.
.IP \fBactions=\fR[\fIaction\fR][\fB,\fIaction\fR...]\fR
Specifies a comma-separated list of actions to take on a packet when
the flow entry matches.  If no \fIaction\fR is specified, then packets
matching the flow are dropped.  See \fBovs\-actions\fR(7) for details
on the syntax and semantics of actions.
K
.PP
An opaque identifier called a cookie can be used as a handle to identify
a set of flows:
.
.IP \fBcookie=\fIvalue\fR
.
A cookie can be associated with a flow using the \fBadd\-flow\fR,
\fBadd\-flows\fR, and \fBmod\-flows\fR commands.  \fIvalue\fR can be any
64-bit number and need not be unique among flows.  If this field is
omitted, a default cookie value of 0 is used.
.
.IP \fBcookie=\fIvalue\fR\fB/\fImask\fR
.
When using NXM, the cookie can be used as a handle for querying,
modifying, and deleting flows.  \fIvalue\fR and \fImask\fR may be
supplied for the \fBdel\-flows\fR, \fBmod\-flows\fR, \fBdump\-flows\fR, and
\fBdump\-aggregate\fR commands to limit matching cookies.  A 1-bit in
\fImask\fR indicates that the corresponding bit in \fIcookie\fR must
match exactly, and a 0-bit wildcards that bit.  A mask of \-1 may be used
to exactly match a cookie.
.IP
The \fBmod\-flows\fR command can update the cookies of flows that
match a cookie by specifying the \fIcookie\fR field twice (once with a
mask for matching and once without to indicate the new value):
.RS
.IP "\fBovs\-ofctl mod\-flows br0 cookie=1,actions=normal\fR"
Change all flows' cookies to 1 and change their actions to \fBnormal\fR.
.IP "\fBovs\-ofctl mod\-flows br0 cookie=1/\-1,cookie=2,actions=normal\fR"
Update cookies with a value of 1 to 2 and change their actions to
\fBnormal\fR.
.RE
.IP
The ability to match on cookies was added in Open vSwitch 1.5.0.
.
.PP
The following additional field sets the priority for flows added by
the \fBadd\-flow\fR and \fBadd\-flows\fR commands.  For
\fBmod\-flows\fR and \fBdel\-flows\fR when \fB\-\-strict\fR is
specified, priority must match along with the rest of the flow
specification.  For \fBmod-flows\fR without \fB\-\-strict\fR,
priority is only significant if the command creates a new flow, that
is, non-strict \fBmod\-flows\fR does not match on priority and will
not change the priority of existing flows.  Other commands do not
allow priority to be specified.
.
.IP \fBpriority=\fIvalue\fR
The priority at which a wildcarded entry will match in comparison to
others.  \fIvalue\fR is a number between 0 and 65535, inclusive.  A higher 
\fIvalue\fR will match before a lower one.  An exact-match entry will always 
have priority over an entry containing wildcards, so it has an implicit 
priority value of 65535.  When adding a flow, if the field is not specified, 
the flow's priority will default to 32768.
.IP
OpenFlow leaves behavior undefined when two or more flows with the
same priority can match a single packet.  Some users expect
``sensible'' behavior, such as more specific flows taking precedence
over less specific flows, but OpenFlow does not specify this and Open
vSwitch does not implement it.  Users should therefore take care to
use priorities to ensure the behavior that they expect.
.
.PP
The \fBadd\-flow\fR, \fBadd\-flows\fR, and \fBmod\-flows\fR commands
support the following additional options.  These options affect only
new flows.  Thus, for \fBadd\-flow\fR and \fBadd\-flows\fR, these
options are always significant, but for \fBmod\-flows\fR they are
significant only if the command creates a new flow, that is, their
values do not update or affect existing flows.
.
.IP "\fBidle_timeout=\fIseconds\fR"
Causes the flow to expire after the given number of seconds of
inactivity.  A value of 0 (the default) prevents a flow from expiring
due to inactivity.
.
.IP \fBhard_timeout=\fIseconds\fR
Causes the flow to expire after the given number of seconds,
regardless of activity.  A value of 0 (the default) gives the flow no
hard expiration deadline.
.
.IP "\fBimportance=\fIvalue\fR"
Sets the importance of a flow.  The flow entry eviction mechanism can
use importance as a factor in deciding which flow to evict.  A value
of 0 (the default) makes the flow non-evictable on the basis of
importance.  Specify a value between 0 and 65535.
.IP
Only OpenFlow 1.4 and later support \fBimportance\fR.
.
.IP "\fBsend_flow_rem\fR"
Marks the flow with a flag that causes the switch to generate a ``flow
removed'' message and send it to interested controllers when the flow
later expires or is removed.
.
.IP "\fBcheck_overlap\fR"
Forces the switch to check that the flow match does not overlap that
of any different flow with the same priority in the same table.  (This
check is expensive so it is best to avoid it.)
.
.IP "\fBreset_counts\fR"
When this flag is specified on a flow being added to a switch, and the
switch already has a flow with an identical match, an OpenFlow 1.2 (or
later) switch resets the flow's packet and byte counters to 0.
Without the flag, the packet and byte counters are preserved.
.IP
OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.1 switches always reset counters in this situation,
as if \fBreset_counts\fR were always specified.
.IP
Open vSwitch 1.10 added support for \fBreset_counts\fR.
.
.IP "\fBno_packet_counts\fR"
.IQ "\fBno_byte_counts\fR"
Adding these flags to a flow advises an OpenFlow 1.3 (or later) switch
that the controller does not need packet or byte counters,
respectively, for the flow.  Some switch implementations might achieve
higher performance or reduce resource consumption when these flags are
used.  These flags provide no benefit to the Open vSwitch software
switch implementation.
.IP
OpenFlow 1.2 and earlier do not support these flags.
.IP
Open vSwitch 1.10 added support for \fBno_packet_counts\fR and
\fBno_byte_counts\fR.
.
.PP
The \fBdump\-flows\fR, \fBdump\-aggregate\fR, \fBdel\-flow\fR 
and \fBdel\-flows\fR commands support these additional optional fields:
.
.TP
\fBout_port=\fIport\fR
If set, a matching flow must include an output action to \fIport\fR,
which must be an OpenFlow port number or name (e.g. \fBlocal\fR).
.
.TP
\fBout_group=\fIgroup\fR
If set, a matching flow must include an \fBgroup\fR action naming
\fIgroup\fR, which must be an OpenFlow group number.  This field
is supported in Open vSwitch 2.5 and later and requires OpenFlow 1.1
or later.
.
.SS "Table Entry Output"
.
The \fBdump\-tables\fR and \fBdump\-aggregate\fR commands print information 
about the entries in a datapath's tables.  Each line of output is a 
flow entry as described in \fBFlow Syntax\fR, above, plus some
additional fields:
.
.IP \fBduration=\fIsecs\fR
The time, in seconds, that the entry has been in the table.
\fIsecs\fR includes as much precision as the switch provides, possibly
to nanosecond resolution.
.
.IP \fBn_packets\fR
The number of packets that have matched the entry.
.
.IP \fBn_bytes\fR
The total number of bytes from packets that have matched the entry.
.
.PP
The following additional fields are included only if the switch is
Open vSwitch 1.6 or later and the NXM flow format is used to dump the
flow (see the description of the \fB\-\-flow-format\fR option below).
The values of these additional fields are approximations only and in
particular \fBidle_age\fR will sometimes become nonzero even for busy
flows.
.
.IP \fBhard_age=\fIsecs\fR
The integer number of seconds since the flow was added or modified.
\fBhard_age\fR is displayed only if it differs from the integer part
of \fBduration\fR.  (This is separate from \fBduration\fR because
\fBmod\-flows\fR restarts the \fBhard_timeout\fR timer without zeroing
\fBduration\fR.)
.
.IP \fBidle_age=\fIsecs\fR
The integer number of seconds that have passed without any packets
passing through the flow.
.
.SS "Packet\-Out Syntax"
.PP
\fBovs\-ofctl bundle\fR command accepts packet-outs to be specified in
the bundle file.  Each packet-out comprises of a series of
\fIfield\fB=\fIvalue\fR assignments, separated by commas or white
space.  (Embedding spaces into a packet-out description normally
requires quoting to prevent the shell from breaking the description
into multiple arguments.).  Unless noted otherwise only the last
instance of each field is honoured.  This same syntax is also
supported by the \fBovs\-ofctl packet-out\fR command.
.PP
.IP \fBin_port=\fIport\fR
The port number to be considered the in_port when processing actions.
This can be any valid OpenFlow port number, or any of the \fBLOCAL\fR,
\fBCONTROLLER\fR, or \fBNONE\fR.
.
This field is required.

.IP \fIpipeline_field\fR=\fIvalue\fR
Optionally, user can specify a list of pipeline fields for a packet-out
message. The supported pipeline fields includes \fBtunnel fields\fR and
\fBregister fields\fR as defined in \fBovs\-fields\fR(7).

.IP \fBpacket=\fIhex-string\fR
The actual packet to send, expressed as a string of hexadecimal bytes.
.
This field is required.

.IP \fBactions=\fR[\fIaction\fR][\fB,\fIaction\fR...]\fR
The syntax of actions are identical to the \fBactions=\fR field
described in \fBFlow Syntax\fR above.  Specifying \fBactions=\fR is
optional, but omitting actions is interpreted as a drop, so the packet
will not be sent anywhere from the switch.
.
\fBactions\fR must be specified at the end of each line, like for flow mods.
.RE

.SS "Group Syntax"
.PP
Some \fBovs\-ofctl\fR commands accept an argument that describes a group or
groups.  Such flow descriptions comprise a series
\fIfield\fB=\fIvalue\fR assignments, separated by commas or white
space.  (Embedding spaces into a group description normally requires
quoting to prevent the shell from breaking the description into
multiple arguments.). Unless noted otherwise only the last instance
of each field is honoured.
.PP
.IP \fBgroup_id=\fIid\fR
The integer group id of group.

This field is required.


.IP \fBtype=\fItype\fR
The type of the group.  The \fBadd-group\fR, \fBadd-groups\fR and
\fBmod-groups\fR commands require this field.  It is prohibited for
other commands. The following keywords designated the allowed types:
.RS
.IP \fBall\fR
Execute all buckets in the group.
.IP \fBselect\fR
Execute one bucket in the group, balancing across the buckets
according to their weights.  To select a bucket, for each live bucket,
Open vSwitch hashes flow data with the bucket ID and multiplies by the
bucket weight to obtain a ``score,'' and then selects the bucket with
the highest score.  Use \fBselection_method\fR to control the flow
data used for selection.

\fIid\fR may be an integer or one of the following keywords:
.RS
.IP \fBall\fR
Operate on all buckets in the group.
Only valid when used with the \fBremove-buckets\fR command in which
case the effect is to remove all buckets from the group.
.IP \fBfirst\fR
Operate on the first bucket present in the group.
In the case of the \fBinsert-buckets\fR command the effect is to
insert new bucets just before the first bucket already present in the group;
or to replace the buckets of the group if there are no buckets already present
in the group.
In the case of the \fBremove-buckets\fR command the effect is to
remove the first bucket of the group; or do nothing if there are no
buckets present in the group.
.IP \fBlast\fR
Operate on the last bucket present in the group.
In the case of the \fBinsert-buckets\fR command the effect is to
insert new bucets just after the last bucket already present in the group;
or to replace the buckets of the group if there are no buckets already present

In the case of the \fBremove-buckets\fR command the effect is to
remove the last bucket of the group; or do nothing if there are no
buckets present in the group.
.RE
.IP
If \fIid\fR is an integer then it should correspond to the \fBbucket_id\fR

\fIid\fR.
In case of the \fBiremove-buckets\fR command the effect is to
remove the in the group whose \fBbucket_id\fR is \fIid\fR.

.IP \fBselection_method\fR=\fImethod\fR
The selection method used to select a bucket for a select group.
This is a string of 1 to 15 bytes in length known to lower layers.
This field is optional for \fBadd\-group\fR, \fBadd\-groups\fR and
\fBmod\-group\fR commands on groups of type \fBselect\fR. Prohibited
otherwise.  If no selection method is specified, Open vSwitch up to
release 2.9 applies the \fBhash\fR method with default fields. From
2.10 onwards Open vSwitch defaults to the \fBdp_hash\fR method with symmetric
L3/L4 hash algorithm, as long as the weighted group buckets can be mapped to
dp_hash values with sufficie
